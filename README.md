As a current fellow into the highly selective Pursuit developer cohort, Iâ€™ve been passionate about computers since I started making applications on my first desktop computer as a kid, which led to my developing web sites using JavaScript.

As an Uber driver in NYC the most rewarding part of my job has been the successful navigation in remote and far flung areas using the proprietary interface, and I am also a NYC Department of Consumer Affairs licensed and proficient contractor for home improvement.

Iâ€™d love to work at a company like Uber that specializes in providing ride sharing services, keeping people connected and providing on demand delivery services.

I listen actively, being highly respectful and showing friendly behavior. I am a person with high potency of tolerance and I hope to be supportive and encouraging with my friends and colleagues alike. Outside of coding I enjoy nice walks and time with family and friends.
