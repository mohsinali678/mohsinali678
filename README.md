### Hi there 👋

As a current fellow into the highly selective Pursuit developer cohort, I’ve been passionate about computers since I started making applications on my first desktop computer as a kid, which led me to developing web sites using JavaScript.

I’d love to work at a company like Uber that specializes in providing ride sharing services, keeping people connected and providing on demand delivery services.

I listen actively, being highly respectful and showing friendly behavior. I am a person with high potency of tolerance and I hope to be supportive and encouraging with my friends and colleagues alike. Outside of coding I enjoy nice walks and time with family and friends.
